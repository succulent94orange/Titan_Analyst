Based on the file structure of your repository (main.py, prompts.py, validation.py, and .env), it appears to be a Python-based application that likely interacts with an LLM (Large Language Model) or an API, using structured prompts and data validation.

Here is a comprehensive README.md file tailored to that structure. You can fill in the bracketed sections (e.g., [Description]) with the specific details of your analysis logic.
Titan Analyst

Titan Analyst is a Python-based tool designed to perform intelligent analysis using structured prompts and validation logic.
📂 Repository Structure

    main.py: The entry point of the application. Contains the primary execution logic and orchestration of the analysis workflow.

    prompts.py: Stores the system prompts, templates, or instructions used to guide the analysis (likely for an LLM or processing engine).

    validation.py: Ensures the integrity of input data or validates the structured output generated by the application.

    .env: Configuration file for storing sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

    .gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., generic temporary files and secrets like .env).

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    pip (Python Package Manager)

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/succulent94orange/Titan_Analyst.git
cd Titan_Analyst

Set up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies: If a requirements.txt is present (create one if not):
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You may need to manually install libraries used in main.py, such as openai, pydantic, python-dotenv, etc.)

Configuration:

    Rename or create a .env file in the root directory.

    Add your necessary environment variables:
    Code snippet

        # Example .env content
        API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        MODEL_NAME=titan-v1

🛠 Usage

To run the analyst tool, execute the main.py script:
Bash

python main.py

🧩 Customization

    Modifying Prompts: Edit prompts.py to tweak the instructions or templates used for analysis.

    Validation Logic: Update validation.py to add new rules or constraints for the data being processed.
